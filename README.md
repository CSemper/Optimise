### Description:
I've been working as a Recruitment Manager for a small sales and marketing company based in Birmingham. As part of my role, I needed to daily screen between 20-100 candidate responses to a Google Form. The task was time-consuming and also quite repetitive.
Optimise is a desktop-based GUI application that was created as a solution to this problem. Although the application is still in the early stages of development, it has already been useful reducing task duration from an hour to mere seconds.
Currently, the team is searching for the best options to deploy the app online using a suitable cloud provider.

### Technologies: 
Language: Python || Testing: Pytest || Other Frameworks: Tkinter, ***Google Cloud, Google Forms API***
